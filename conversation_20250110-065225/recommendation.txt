3. **Smell Identification Test**: To assess the degree of olfactory dysfunction, as the patient reports a noticeable decrease in their sense of smell.
4. **Skin Prick Test** or **IgE Blood Test**: To evaluate for allergic rhinitis, which could be a contributing factor to the recurrent episodes of symptoms suggestive of chronic sinusitis.
