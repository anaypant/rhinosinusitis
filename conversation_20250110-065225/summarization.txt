**Patient Summary**

The patient presents with a three-week history of persistent symptoms, including a runny nose, productive cough with excessive mucus, 
and a noticeable decrease in their sense of smell. These symptoms are consistent throughout the day, without notable worsening at night or upon lying down. The patient reports no associated facial pressure or pain. A low-grade fever was present initially but resolved after about a week.

There is no recent travel history, exposure to sick contacts, or known allergies reported. The patient does not currently take any 
medications and denies any pre-existing medical conditions that may contribute to their symptoms. This episode represents one of several annual recurrences, with the patient estimating four similar events per year.

Despite the prolonged duration of symptoms, the patient has not initiated any treatment or home remedies prior to seeking medical attention. Given the frequency and recurrence of these symptoms, further evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management strategy. Consideration should be given to potential chronic sinusitis or another underlying condition necessitating specialized care.
